# Problems, not Solutions

You will find no solutions here, only problems and headaches. This repo is home to **issue-related** documents. 

Typically this will include:
- minimal example to recreate a bug or display limitation.
- stack trace (txt)
- some sort of visualisation (e.g., png; optional)
